## Qualitative Analysis methods - I

<hr>

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Six main methods

1.  **Content** analysis
2.  **Narrative** analysis
3.  **Discourse** analysis
4.  **Thematic** analysis
5.  Grounded theory'
6.  IPA
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
1.  [**Content** analysis]{.gcpsred}
    -   Examines patterns in words, images, etc
    -   Identify frequency of words, phrases, etc
    -   Group into frequency, etc
    -   Need to approach with a plan e.g. [*"How many times does 'happy' appear in my
        interview?"*]{.red}
    -   Can be time consuming
    -   Can miss some important info in the data
:::
:::

## Qualitative Analysis methods - II

<hr>

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
2.  [**Narrative** analysis]{.gcpsred}
    -   Listening to people telling stories and analysing
    -   Pay attention to what and how story is told.
    -   E.g.: Narrative of a customer about a product
        -   Listen
        -   Analysimpressionson, likes, hate, etc
    -   *Disadvantages*: Small sample size and poor reproducibility

    -   Culture and circumstances are important here
    -   E.g.: Analyse how a CEO speaks to his employees
    -   Should have specific research question beforehand
    -   Involves sampling to saturation (New data adds no more information)
:::
:::

## Qualitative Analysis methods - III

<hr>

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
4.  [**Thematic** analysis]{.gcpsred}

## What is quantitative research

<hr>

-   Usually deals with numbers and statistics
-   Used to [**measure**]{style="color: red; font-weight: bold"} differences or
    [**test**]{style="color: red; font-weight: bold"} between groups

## Study designs

<hr>

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Descriptive**

-   Case study & series
-   Cross-sectional study
-   Qualitative study

<br>

**Exploratory**

-   Cohort study
-   Case control study
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Experimental**

-   True experimental designs
-   Quasi-experimental designs

<br>

**Others**

-   Systematic Review
-   Meta-analysis
:::
:::

## Cross-sectional Study

<hr>

-   Researcher studies a stratified group of subjects at one point in time
-   Draws conclusions by comparing the characteristics of the stratified groups
-   Well-suited to describing variables and their distribution patterns
-   Can be used for examining associations;
-   Determination of which variables are predictors, and which are outcomes depends on the
    hypothesis:

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Example

*Does lead paint ingestion cause hyperactivity OR does hyperactivity lead to lead paint ingestion?*
:::

## Cross-sectional study

<hr>

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Strengths**

-   Fast and inexpensive
-   No loss to follow-up (no follow-up)
-   Ideal for studying prevalence
-   Convenient for examining potential networks of causal links
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Weaknesses:**

-   Cannot establish causal relationship
-   Does not establish sequence of events)
-   Not practical for studying rare phenomena
:::
:::

## Cohort Study

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## What is a cohort?

**A group of individuals who do not yet have the outcome of interest are followed together over time
to see who develops the condition**
:::

-   Participants are interviewed or observed to determine the presence or absence of certain
    exposures, risks, or characteristics
-   May be simply descriptive
-   May identify risk by comparing the incidence of specific outcomes in exposed and not exposed
    participants

## Cohort Study

<hr>

::: columns
::: {.column wifth="50%"}
**Strengths**

-   Powerful strategy for defining incidence and investigating potential causes of an outcome before
    it occurs
-   Time sequence strengthens inference that the factor may cause the outcome
:::

::: {.column wifth="50%"}
**Weaknesses**

-   Expensive, many subjects must be studied to observe outcome of interest
-   Potential confounders: eg, cigarette smoking might confound the association between exercise and
    CHD
:::
:::

## Case-Control Study

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Generally retrospective

-   Identify groups
    -   Cases (outcome present)
    -   Controls (Outcome absent)
    -   Matched or unmatched
-   Look backward in time to find differences in:
    -   Predictor variables
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Assumption:**

-   Differences in exposure =\> Different outcomes

**Data collection** via:

-   Direct interview
-   Mailed questionnaire

-   Useful for generating hypotheses
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Weaknesses**

-   Increased susceptibility to bias
    -   Separate sampling of cases and controls
    -   Retrospective measurement of predictor variables
-   No way to estimate the excess risk of exposure
-   Only one outcome can be studied
:::
:::

## Experimental studies

<hr>

-   To compare 2 or more groups by:
    -   Randomization
    -   Non-randomization

**Assumption**:

-   The groups differ solely on the intervention applied\
-   Changes from pretest to posttest can be reasonably attributed to the intervention
-   Most basic is the pretest-posttest control group design (RCT)

## Experimental studies II

<hr>

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Strengths**

-   Controls the influence of confounding variables
-   Randomization eliminates bias
-   Blinding the interventions eliminates bias
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Weaknesses**

-   Costly in time and money
-   Many research questions are not suitable for experimental designs
-   Usually reserved for more mature research questions
-   Experiments tend to restrict the scope and narrow the study question
:::
:::

## Quasi-Experimental studies

<hr>

-   Aims to establish a cause-and-effect relationship
-   Useful when true experiment cannot be done (ethical, practical, etc)
-   Do not use randomized assignments for comparisons (Non-random assignment)
-   Control group not mandatory

::: {.callout-note title="Example"}
To investigate the relationship between Smoking and immediated Blood pressure measurement
:::

## Sampling

<hr>

**Population in research**

-   [Target population]{.highlight}: Any specified group (usually large) of persons, things, or
    measurement values, e.g. the study population, the sampled population, the target population.
-   [Study population]{.highlight}: This is a subset of a population, whose properties have been, or
    are to be, generalized to the larger population or set.
-   [Sampling]{.highlight}: This is a process of picking a sample from the population.
-   [Sample]{.highlight}: Members of the study population who are selected for the study. Should be
    representative of the target population

## Sample size – Comparing 2 means {style="color: #000000; font-size: 34px;"}

<hr>

-   $\mu_A$ is the mean in group A
-   $\mu_B$ is the mean in group B
-   $n_A$ is the sample size in first group
-   $n_B$ is the sample size in second group
-   $\kappa = \frac{n_A}{n_B}$ is the matching ratio
-   $\alpha$ is the type I error rate
-   $\beta$ is the type II error

$$n_A=\kappa n_B \;\text{ and }\;
        n_B=\left(1+\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)
            \left(\sigma\frac{z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}}{\mu_A-\mu_B}\right)^2$$

        -   10% verification
        -   Whole database verification
    -   **Double entry**
        -   Create identical database
        -   Double enter data
        -   Picks data entry errors
        -   Compare the data from both databases
        -   Identify discrepancies
        -   Correct errors as necessary

## Data Warehousing

<hr>

**Always remember to:**

-   Backup the data regularly – 3 copies
-   Backup with versions and dates
-   Keep in the appropriate format
    -   Microsoft Excel
    -   Text files
    -   PDF
    -   Tiff

## Data migration & cleaning

<hr>

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Cleaning

-   Involves picking out
    -   Erroneous and
    -   Missing data
-   Picks up
    -   Data collection & entry errors
-   Strategy depends on
    -   Continuous variable
    -   Discrete variable
    -   Categorical

::: {.column width="50%"}
Migration

-   Moving data around
-   Should be in stable state
-   Not all software requires this

## Variable types

<hr>

1.  Independent (predictor) variable
    -   Potentially influences, affects or predicts another variable
    -   E.g: How age influences income make age the independent variable
2.  Dependent (predicted) variable
    -   Potentially predicted, influenced and affected by another variable
    -   E.g: How age influences income make income the dependent variable
3.  Software
    -   R - Analysis only
    -   Microsoft Excel - Entry and analysis
    -   Stata - Analysis only
    -   SPSS - Entry and analysis

## Data analysis

<hr>

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Descriptive analysis

-   Describe your data
-   Categorical variables
    -   Univariate
        -   Frequencies + percentages
    -   Bivariate
        -   Frequencies + percentage
-   Numerical variables
    -   Normally distributed: Mean(SD)
    -   Not normally distributed: Median(IQR)

Inferential analysis

-   Uses sampled data to draw conclusions about a larger population.
-   Allows you to make generalizations about a population based on data from samples.
-   Involves testing hypotheses and deriving estimates
    -   P-values
    -   Confidence intervals

# Mixed methods {.center background-color="#505A5B"}

## What is mixed-methods research

<hr>

-   Bring quantitative and qualitative researches together
-   Qualitative component: Used to explore and develop hypothesis
-   Quantitative component: Used to test the hypothesis
-   Assumed to be advantageous to either of the two alone
-   Analysis involves both quantitative and qualitative methods

## Mixed methodology - types

<hr>

5 main types

1.  Convergent parallel design
2.  Explanatory sequential design
3.  Exploratory sequential design
4.  Embedded design
5.  Transformative Design
6.  multiphase design

## Convergenet parallel design

<hr>

-   Simulative collect of both qualitative and Quantitative data
-   Merged but data analysed done seperately
-   Results used to complement each other
-   Advantages:
    -   Combines the two data types
    -   Quantitative =\> generalisability
    -   Qualitative =\> provides indepth understanding

E.g: Factors affecting practicing of KMC

## Explanatory sequential design

<hr>

-   Also know as two-phased design
-   Sarts with quantitave and then qualitattive study
-   Qualitative gives indepth knowledge behind the results obtianed in quantitative

E.g: Factors affecting practicing of KMC

-   Quantitative: Determine factors
-   Qualitative: Detemine the thinking behind the observed data

## Exploratory qualitative design

<hr>

-   Similar to above
-   Qualitative done before quantitative
-   Qualitative helps to
    -   Design design quantitative methodology
    -   Design instrument or questionnnaire

E.g: Factors affecting practicing of KMC

## Take home messagge

<hr>

-   Three types of methodology
    -   Qualliative
    -   Quantitative
    -   Mixed
-   They all have their individual strengths and weakness
-   Know which will best fit your objectives
