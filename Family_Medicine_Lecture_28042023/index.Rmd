# Our study for the day
----

## Aim
- Determine if __New Drug__ has a better BP lowering effect after 2 weeks of administration compared to the __Control Drug__

## Study type
- Randomized Controlled Trial

## Variable to be collected
- Age in years
- Sex
- Initial BP
- Final BP

---
# Our study for the day
----
## Study questions
- How much does the **New drug** lower the BP?
- How much does the **Control drug** lower the BP?
- Which of the two drugs **lowers the BP better**?
- Is there a difference in the **BP lowering effect** of the two drugs?
- Is the **BP lowering effect** related to the **age** of the patient?
- Is the **BP lowering effect** related to the **sex** of the patient?

    - `age_group`:
        - Elderly: >60 years
        - Middle age: <=60 years

## Risk Ratio (RR)

$$= \frac{Incidence\ in\ the\ exposed}{Incidence\ in\ the\ non-exposed} = \frac{R_e}{𝑅_𝑢}$$
- Used for estimation of causal relationship
- Can be calculated in cohort studies
- Higher RR => Better causal relationship
    - RR=1      =>  No evidence of association
    - RR $\neq$ 1   =>  Exposure is harmful or protective

---

## Odds Ratio (OR)

$$= \frac{Odds\ in\ the\ exposed}{Odds\ in\ the\ non-exposed} = \frac{Odds_e}{Odds_𝑢}$$
- Used for estimation of causal relationship
- Can be calculated in case-control studies
- Higher RR => Better causal relationship

---
# p-value
----
- Well known in research
- Very often misinterpreted and overemphasized

> .red[**It is the probability of having a statistic as extreme as the one observed from the sample if the null hypothesis is true. It determines the strength of support for the null hypothesis.**]

- The nearer p-value is to 1 the better the data at hand or test statistic supports the null value.

---
#Hypothesis testing
----
1. State (Null) hypothesis (H0) 
1. Decide on significance level (α) usually 0.05
1. Determine sample size
1. Collect data (Evidence)
1. Apply appropriate statistical test
1. Compute the probability value (p-value) 
1. We compare the p-value with α 
    1. If p < α Then: Reject the H0 (Guilty)
    1. If p >= α Then: Refuse to reject the H0 (Not guilty)


Generally:
- Lower p-value: More confident of rejecting the H0
- Note that failure to reject H0 does not mean H0 is true. It means we do not have enough evidence to reject it

---
# Is there a difference in the BP lowering effect of the two drugs?

**H0**: No difference in BP lowering effect between the two drugs

**Conclusion:** Based on the p-value we reject the H0 and thus conclude there is a significant difference between the BP lowering effect of the New drug and Control
