# Determinants of appropriate statistical analysis
----
- What is the research question(s) 
- What is/are the objective(s)?
- What type of variables were collected?
    - Relate variables required for each objective
- What is the study methodology?
- What is the sample size?
- How many .red[**missing variables**]?
- How do you intend to deal with missing?

---
# Common pitfalls

----

.pull-left[
## Statistical analysis
- Poorly written
- Does not conform to analysis done
- Wrong statistical tests applied
- Wrongful dichotomization
- Assumption of test not evaluated
- Missing data: How much was present and how they were dealt with.
- Analysis does not conform to basis for the sample size determination
]

.pull-right[
## Reporting
- P-value not reported as exact (NS)
- Wrong interpretation of P-value (Especially combo p-values)
- Data dredging (p-hacking)
- Ignoring confounders and effect modifiers
- Obvious bias: "Almost significant"
- Transcription errors.

# An example statistical analysis

> Data Analysis: Statistical analysis was done with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 21.0 (Chicago Ill, IBM). Qualitative variables were summarized as frequencies (percentages), while quantitative variables were summarized as means (standard deviation). Student’s t-test, analysis of variance, or Chi-square test was used, as appropriate, to determine the statistical significance of the difference between the two groups. P <0.05 was taken as statistically significant.

---
# What is the research question?

----
Some study questions may appear "the same" but are very different!

# Paramatric vs. Non-parametric test?

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Outline]
.pull-left[
##Parametric
- Must be interval data
- Approximately normally distributed
- Approximately normally distributed on transformation
- Enough sample size?

E.g: T-test, ANOVA, etc
]
.pull-right[
##Non-parametric
- Alternative to parametric
- Does not require a specific distribution 
- Can handle low samples sizes
- Interpretation can be difficult
]
]

.panel[.panel-name[Assumption]
- Statistical tests have assumptions
- More stringent in parametric tests
- These should be evaluated for before using the test
- E.g.: For a Student's T-test:
    1. Independence of observations
    2. Normality of data
    3. Homogeneity of Variances
    4. Random Sampling methodology
    5. Adequacy of sample size
